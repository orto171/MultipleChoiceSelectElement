# MultipleChoiceSelectElement
A small solution to handle the missing functionality of checkboxes in a Select HTML element.

I got a task from a client to add a new filter manu to our UI project. the new filter should have a multiple choice functuinality, 
and the client asked me to implement it using checkboxes. 
At the beginning, I tried to implement it using Select HTML element. after short investigation, I realized I can't add checkboxes to a 
select element, and need an alternative solotion.
The desired functionality can be achieved by a combination of HTML, CSS and TS. I added a TS function that being called when the client clicks
the menu, this function makes the menu section stay open, and allows the user to click several checkboxes in one usage.
